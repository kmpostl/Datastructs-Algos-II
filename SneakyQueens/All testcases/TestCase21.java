// SneakyQueens: TestCase21.java
// =============================
//
// THIS IS A BONUS TEST CASE.
//
// A large test case where the first two queens in the ArrayList can attack one
// another. As soon as you see that two queens can attack one another in
// allTheQueensAreSafe(), the rational thing to do is to stop and return false
// immediately. This test case checks that the function returns very quickly.
