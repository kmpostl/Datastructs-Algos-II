Collection of java built algorithms and datastructures from Comp Sci II course. <br>Mostly HW where every folder is a seperate HW. <br>Testcases not created by me.  <br>Each contains description of problem in pdf format. <br>I can't fully remember but I believe all should be runnable via navigating to folder and opening powershell/terminal/cmd and running <b>"bash test-all.sh"</b>. <br>shell script should be in root of each individual project. <br>Note these projects are not perfect answers to the question and there is still much to learn.
<br><br>Check out Extras folder to see problem thought process in pdf format written in noteability
